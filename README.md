# word-square-rs
An implenentation of a backtacking algorithm to find word squares and rectangles from a given list of words. The implementation was inspired and losely based on [HackerPoet/WordSquares](https://github.com/HackerPoet/WordSquares), but is more general (works with any arbitrary character set) and implements a basic CLI and multithreading. Without multithreading word-square-rs performs comparably to the originaal C++ code depsite using a having to perform a hash lookups intead of basic indexing.
